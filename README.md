# AI-Enhanced Open-RAN Optimizer

## Project Overview
An AI-based solution aimed at optimizing 5G Open RAN networks, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to boost network efficiency and performance.

## Approach & Methodology
Incorporating cutting-edge AI methodologies such as:
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
- Deep learning and neural network architectures
- Reinforcement learning approaches
- Natural language processing (NLP) tools

Integrated seamlessly with Open RAN standards for full compatibility and scalability.

## Main Features
-  **Network Anomoly Detection**: Detecting network performance issues in real time using sophisticated analysis techniques.
-  **Predictive Network**: Predicting traffic patterns and intelligently allocating resources ahead of time.
-  **Network Optimizer**: Adjusting network resources in real-time based on operational and environmental factors.
-  **Energy Optimizer**: Managing energy consumption effectively through data-driven resource allocation.
